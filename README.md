# AirBnB-Room-Booking-Analysis
This project gives us clear insights about the bookings made by customers, analyzing their choices of bookings, also the category of room types offered by AirBnB and the most booked room type which generated higher sales and eventually boosted the revenue.

Here, we have primarily used python to gather, clean, preprocess and tranform data using its libraries and for visualization, we have used matplotlib and seaborn so as to generate insights from visuals and share the findings to relevant stakeholders.

For the future scope of this project, we can load the data into any of the RDBMS and solve business use cases to get detaioled understanding of the problem statement.
Further we can load the data from SQL Relational DB to Power BI using SQL connectors and further use it for better and interactive visualization through KPIs.
